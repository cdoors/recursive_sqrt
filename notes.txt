# Recursive function to find the square root of a number
def sqrt(x, guess=1.0, tolerance=0.001):
    # Base case: if the guess is close enough, return it
    if abs(guess * guess - x) < tolerance:
        return guess
    
    # Recursive case: improve the guess and call the function again
    new_guess = (guess + x / guess) / 2
    return sqrt(x, new_guess, tolerance)

# Example usage:
# result = sqrt(16)
# print(result)  # Output will be close to 4
