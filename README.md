# Exploring Recursion with Square Root Calculation

This project demonstrates the power of recursion using a simple yet elegant example: calculating the square root of a number.

## Overview

We implement a recursive function to approximate the square root of a given number using the Newton-Raphson method. This approach showcases how a complex problem can be solved through repeated self-similar steps, a key concept in recursive programming.

## Key Features

- **Recursive Implementation**: The `sqrt` function calls itself with improved guesses until the desired accuracy is achieved.
- **Newton-Raphson Method**: Utilizes this numerical analysis technique for efficient approximation.
- **Customizable Precision**: Allows adjustment of the tolerance level for different accuracy needs.
